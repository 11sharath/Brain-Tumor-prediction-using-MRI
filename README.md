BRAIN TUMOUR DETECTION FROM MRI SCANS
Statement:
Brain tumours can be life-threatening if not diagnosed at an early stage. Manual diagnosis using MRI scans is time-consuming, requires high expertise, and is prone to human error, especially in early or subtle cases.
The challenge is to develop an automated system that accurately detects and classifies brain tumours from MRI images to assist radiologists in faster and more precise diagnoses.
Description:
Using MRI brain scan datasets, create an image classification model that can detect the presence of tumours and, if present, classify them into types (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumour). 
The system should help doctors make quicker decisions and prioritize patients who need urgent treatment.
